# OSGE-14-Open-Source-Game-Engine-14
The Best game engine made with .Net Framework and winforms (yes, i used winforms, im a madlad B) and is still in development

Do note that its having a few bugs and fixing.

Update 18th December 2021: Im still working on this project but ive not gotten time in my day to update it (mostly school work and other crAp) but now im free, development is going ***FULL FLIPPING THROTTLE BABY!!***

Update Log:

The Game Engine has ONE, MAJOR, ISSUE!!!, its called C#, nah but its the code, its only designed to check each line for code, so, it looks like we need to go, DEEPER(in the microsoft documentation for C#)
