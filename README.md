# OSGE-14-Open-Source-Game-Engine-14
The Best game engine made with .Net Framework and winforms (yes, i used winforms, im a madlad B) and is still in development

Do note that its having a few bugs and fixing.

Update Log 20/12/2021 (20th of December 2021):

FINNALY A GOOD FLIPING UPDATE, the new update includes;

  **-IF STATEMENTS**

  <!--the boring backstory:
    one night, i was tired of thinking how to make if statements, but after a few methods, IT WORKED!!!-->
  A few bugs do exist though, so please tell me them if they do appear.

  THE SYNTAX:
  
    if *your code here* then

    *code*

    end
   
 **-New Ui Changes**
  the Ui for when you run the project has been made more *modern*.
  
 **Fixed Wrong/Incorrect error messages**
  Now normally the Error messages weren't, in proper grammer, and the error message display, for example if the Scripts had an error, the message would say:
    
    An Exception Error Occurred in ScreenGui
    
  as you see, it was only accounting for the screenGUI which isnt always the case so now it says:
  
    An Exception Error Occurred, please see below
    
    *Exception error message*
    
    Please Check with your code if you have made no mistakes, if not, please contact Mervinpais(check github repo for Mervin's contact by either gmail or any other means)
 its along the lines of this and its good since the "*Exception error message*" part can display what error happened, either its a C# Exception Error OR a coding exception (example if a user made variable doesnt exist)
 
 Thats most of the changes made with version 3.1 
 
 Thank for reading :)
